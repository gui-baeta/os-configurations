### This Repo is
My NixOS configs, and in general Nix related configs

### TODO
- [ ] Configure nixfmt. See: [nixfmt GitHub](https://github.com/NixOS/nixfmt)
- [ ] Using something like Vim seems practical a lot of times. See: [Helix Editor](https://helix-editor.com/)
    - [ ] If actually going to Vim. For ideas and as a reference: [From JetBrains to Vim: A modern Vim configuration and plugin set](https://medium.com/@devsjc/from-jetbrains-to-vim-a-modern-vim-configuration-and-plugin-set-d58472a7d53d)
- [ ] On transition to Flakes, read and follow: [Setting up my machines Nix-style](https://aldoborrero.com/posts/2023/01/15/setting-up-my-machines-nix-style/)
    - [ ] Also follow this complete guide: [NixOS with Flakes enabled](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/nixos-with-flakes/nixos-with-flakes-enabled)
### Maybe
- [ ] Configure cache: [How to set up a Nix binary cache with Terraform in DigitalOcean & Cloudflare](https://aldoborrero.com/posts/2022/11/25/how-to-set-up-a-nix-binary-cache-with-terraform-in-digitalocean--cloudflare/)
